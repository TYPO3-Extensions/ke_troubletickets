* new config option: hide listview / teaserview if there are no tickets available
* fixed bug: don't use filter from session data if in teaser own or teaser delegated view since then there may be no output and it's not possible to change the filter in teaser view (at least when using the default template)
* new feature: owner may be selected in frontend, new flexform field to select usergroup for that function, hast to be activated in typoscript
* new feature: viewtype selector in listview: detailed and short view (update your template: if you use your own template, you'll have to include the new markers and subparts to use it)
* new feature: changed fields are now marked in the email-notifications (update your template)
* fixed bug: description field is rendered differently in email-notifications so that e.g. <script>-parts are visible
* fixed bug: non working option "notification on status change"
* new feature: conditions for when to send a notification mail can now be set very exact via typoscript. Please see setup.txt for an explanation.
* fixed bug: check for the right sysfolder. Before that tickets from other sysfolders other than the defined starting point could be opened (although the permission check worked correctly, that means you could only open tickets you had access to).
* re-implemented feature: Added Datetimepicker-Javascript which works with TYPO3 4.3. Although it's not localized and styled fully yet.
* new feature: It's now possible to preselect an responsible user for new tickets in the backend.
* cleanup: Cleaned up user sheet in flexform a bit.
* fixed bug: file deletion was not possible because of colon in URL. Now a pipe is used instead of the colon.
* new feature: in dropdowns you can no force an empty dropdown element. This may be used to force frontend users to select a category (instead of just leave the default category which is the first in the list). See setup.txt formFieldList.80 for an example.
* new feature: fields can now be validated as „float“ value. This is activated by default for the fields „time_planned“ and „time_used“, but can also be activated for the field „effort“ (which is still a text field in the database).
* little css change in the list view.
* bugfix: typoscript notification did not work on keyword comment
* rte in frontend is larger now by default (configurable in typoscript)
* new feature: write access to form fields can now be restricted to a usergroup (writeAccessOnlyForUserGroup). see setup.txt.
* changed behaviour: close_time is now set only the first time you close a ticket. That means once you close a ticket, the closing time stays on that timestamp, even if you re-open a ticket and then close it again.
* new feature: validation method „notAllowedWhenClosing“. If you want to force users to select a value from the dropdown which differs from the default value, you may use the validation method "notAllowedWhenClosing". Write down the value which is not allowed after the colon. When the ticket gets closed, the validation applies.
* Example: plugin.tx_ketroubletickets_pi1.formFieldList.25.validate = notAllowedWhenClosing:open
* new feature: changeWaitStatusOnNewComment. If you want tickets that have the "wait" status to change their status whenever a new comment is submitted, enter the desired status here.
* Example: plugin.tx_ketroubletickets_pi1.changeWaitStatusOnNewComment = open
* bugfix: link to file did not open in new window. Thanks to Esben Fest.
* changed ts path to preview thumbnail image
* new subpart in the template for file attachments
* new feature, behavior change: If the owner, the responsible user or the observers have changed treat the former owner, former responsible user and former observers temporarily as observers (for this change only). For example, This notifies former responsible users that they are not responsible anymore.
* added default font size in css.
* new feature: locked tickets. This is a new status a ticket can have. Locked tickets cannot be edited anymore, at least by normal users. Internal users may edit the status field and re-open a ticket. The fields which may be edited in locked tickets are configurable via typoscript.
* new feature: follow-up ticket. Create a new ticket which is automatically related to the current ticket and prefill the new ticket with some values from the old one: category, billing, priority, owner, responsible user, observers. Useful in combination with „locked tickets“.

* bugfix: If a validation error occurs on updating a ticket, remember the values the user entered.
* Added support for date2cal for TYPO3 versions 4.3 and greater. Needs date2cal 7.3.0 or greater.

* bugfix: Fix charset problem in notification emails
* bugfix: set the "close_time" field, if the ticket is directy set to "closed" the moment it's created.
* On follow-up-tickets add the owner of the parent ticket as observer to the new ticket.
* the "project leader function": If a user is the responsible user of a ticket and delegates that ticket to another user, automatically add the former responsible user to the list of observers. That only happens if the responsible user himself changes the responsibility. Typoscript option: addResponsibleUserAsObserverAfterDelegation
* Don't send notification emails twice to a user (e.g. if he is observer and responsible user).
* Don't send notification emails to the user who changed the ticket. Can be activated with typoscript option sendNotificationsToSelf.
